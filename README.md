# PyNeat

This is a simple library which implements the NEAT algorithm in Python.

Further extension to do in the future:
- Append Unittests for each class/methods
- Implement different Selection Types (as classes)
- Implement an adjusted threshold for Species
- Implement an adjusted probabilities for topology mutation and weight/bias changing mutation
- Seperate bias as one node?
- Make training more efficient and more flexible
- Make further optimizations
